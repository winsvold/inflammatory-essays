A cruel but ancient law demands an eye for an eye. Murder must be answered by execution. Only god has the right to take a life and when someone breaks this law he will be punished. Justice must come swiftly. It doesn't help anyone to stall. The victim's family cries out for satisfaction, the community begs for protection and the departed craves vengeance so he can rest. The killer knew in advance there was no excuse for his act, truly he has taken his own life. He, not society, is responsible for his fate. He alone stands guilty and damned.
