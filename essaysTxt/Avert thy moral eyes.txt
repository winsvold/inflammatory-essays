Avert thy moral eyes from sights that sear the orbs of men. Keep thy thoughts from the labyrinthine path that leads from arrogant knowledge to fiery destruction. Seek not the lightning strike that summons life nor the dark vortex that is death before redemption. Neither cry aloud nor shake clenched fists at the god whose plan is terrible but perfect. Conceive no theories, build no stopgaps against the inevitable and the divine. Instead, love thy wife and tender children, grasp and savor the bounteous earth. Concern thyself with what was freely given as thy birthright. Venture more and invite perdition.
