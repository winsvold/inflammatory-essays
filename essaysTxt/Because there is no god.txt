Because there is no god someone must take responsibility for men. A charismatic leader is imperative. He can subordinate the small wills to the great one. His strength and his vision redeem men. His perfection makes them grateful. Life itself is not sacred, there is no dignity in the flesh. Undirected men are content with random, squalid, pointless lives. The leader gives direction and purpose. The leader forces great accomplishments, mandates peace and repels outside aggressors. He is the architect of destiny. He demands absolute loyalty. He merits unquestioning devotion. He asks the supreme sacrifice. He is the only hope.
