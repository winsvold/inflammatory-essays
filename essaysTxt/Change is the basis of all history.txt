Change is the basis of all history, the proof of vigor. The old is soiled and disgusting by nature. Stale food is repellent, monogamous love breeds contempt, senility cripples the government that is too powerful too long. Upheaval is desirable because fresh, untainted groups seize oppurtunity. Violent overthrow is appropriate when the situation is intolerable. Slow modification can be effective; men change before they notice and resist. The decadent and the powerful champion continuity. "Nothing essential changes." That is a myth. It will be refuted. The necessary birth convulsions will be triggered. Action will bring the evidence to your doorstep.
