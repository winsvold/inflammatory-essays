Repressing sex urges is so bad. Poison dams up inside and then it must come out. When sex is held back too long it comes out fast and wild. It can do a lot of harm. Innocent people get shot or cut by confused sex urges. They don't know what hit them until too late. Parents should let children express themselves so they don't get mean early. Adults should make sure they find many outlets. All people should respond to big sex needs. Don't make fun of individuals and send them away. It's better to volunteer than to get forcred.
