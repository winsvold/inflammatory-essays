Sentimentality delays the removal of the dangerously backward and the unfit. Rigorous selection is mandatory in policy making and population management. Incorrect merciful impulses postpone the cleansing that precedes reform. Short-term niceties must yield to long-range necessity. Morals will be revised to meet the requirements of today. Meaningless platitudes will be pulled from tongues and minds. Words like purge and euthanasia deserve new cannotations. They should be recognized as the rational social instruments they are. The greatest danger is not excessive zeal but undue hesitation. We will learn to imitate nature. Her kills nourish strong life. Squeamishness is the crime.
