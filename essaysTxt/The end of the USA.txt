The end of the U.S.A. All you rich fuckers see the beginning of the end and take what you can while you can. You imagine that you will get away, but you've shit in your own bed and you're the one to sleep in it. Why should everyone else stay behind and smell your stinking cowardice? Here's a message to you - space travel is uncertain and any refuge of yours can be blown of the map. There's no other place for you to go. Know that your future is with us so don't give us more reasons to hate you.
