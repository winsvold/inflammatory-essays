What scares peasants is thinking their bodies will be thrown out in public and left to rot. They feel shame - as if it matters what position their legs are in when they're dead. Lucky they're superstitious because they're easier to manage. Make an example of 2 or 3 rebels, drop their bodies by a road, get them flat and dry so bones show and the grass wears the clothes. Shoot the fingers off anyone who comes to collect the remains. Those bodies stay as a sign of absolute authority. If peasants think their souls can't rest, so much the better.
